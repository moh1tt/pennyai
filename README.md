# PennyAI

**PennyAI** is an open-source project designed to uncover emerging penny stock opportunities by combining **Reddit discussion data**, **market fundamentals**, and **AI-driven summarization**.

It automatically gathers the latest posts and comments from subreddits like `r/pennystocks` and `r/wallstreetbets`, extracts stock tickers and sentiment, enriches them with live company and market data from **Yahoo Finance**, and produces structured insights ready for LLM analysis.

The long-term vision is to build a **web application** that provides real-time summaries of trending penny stocks — highlighting their popularity, sentiment, and financial signals — to help retail investors and data enthusiasts make more informed, data-backed decisions.
